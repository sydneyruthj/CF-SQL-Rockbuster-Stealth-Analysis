# CF-SQL-Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis
This is work that I performed in PostgreSQL as part of my Career Foundry curriculum. Rockbuster is a fictionalized movie rental company whose data I analyzed to find trends in sales.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to provide data-driven answers to questions that the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board could use for their upcoming annual strategy. 

Rockbuster's questions included:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographical regions?
  
## Data
The data set for this project was around 3MB. Multiple data files were loaded into a RDBMS. The data consisted of 14 interconnected tables. An ERD I built using DbVisualizer can be found here:

## Tools
I wrote all of my SQL queries using PostgreSQL in PgAdmin 4 and designed my visualizations in Tableau. [A link to an interactive map I built in Tableau can be found here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterMap_17192522289990/Map?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
